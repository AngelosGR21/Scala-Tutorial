Creating a project via the sbt command (sbt is a build tool for scala)


Creating a scala project: sbt new scala/scala3.g8 

Running the project : 
1. cd into the project directory
2. Run "sbt" this will open the sbt console
3. Type ~run (the ~ is optional and causes sbt to re-run on every file save)


Adding a dependency: 

Inside build.sbt, we can add dependencies by appending to the libraryDependencies 

libraryDependencies += "org.scala-lang.modules" %% "scala-parser-combinators" % "2.1.1"

To add multiple dependencies

 libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      "org.scalameta" %% "munit" % "1.0.0" % Test,
      "com.example" %% "example-library" % "1.0.0"
    )

Scaladex is the place where to find dependencies
