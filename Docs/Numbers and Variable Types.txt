Number types

Type = Size (bits) =   Min value        =     Max value
Byte =      8      =    -128            =      127
Short=     16      =    -32768          =      32767
Int  =     32      =    -2147483648     =      2147483647 (2^31 - 1)
Long =     64      =    -9,223,372,036..=      9,223,372,036.... 

Decimal Types

Type = Size (bits) =   Decimal Digits
Float=     32      =    6-7
Double=    64      =    15-16


We can add _ between numbers to increase readability for long number for example

If we have long numbers (For example longer than 2.147b) we need to add the L at the end of the number to
specify that the number is Long.

Same goes for Float decimals if we want to tag them as floats


Implicit vs Explicit

Implicit numbers are decided by scala (For example assigning val cats = 3 // Int)
Scala will decide the most appropriate variable type based on the value provided

We can instruct Scala to assign a different type to our variables
val dogs: Byte = 5 // Byte

Type conversions

Variable of certain type can be converted into a different type
val cats = 3 // Int
val longCats = cats.toLong // Long

If we convert to a smaller type some information will be lost
