Collections are a way to group elements together

Iterable is the main class out of which all the other collection data structures are derived from

0. Iterators
Iterators is an object that loops through elements of a collection
They are useful when we want to apply the same logic to all elements

1. List - immutable (is like an array but is immutable)

Ordered collection
Elements can be accessed by the position (index)
Can contain duplicate elements

2. Array - mutable

3. Set

group of unique elements
The order has no significance
We can iterate through them but the order is not defined


4. HashSet

5. Map
A set of key-value pairs
keys are unique
values can be duplicates
There's no order


6. HashMap

7. Tuple - immutable
A fixed size group of various data types
Can contain duplicates
The type of tuple depends on the number of elements
