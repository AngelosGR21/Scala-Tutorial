Tuple - An ordered immutable group of elements


We can specify how many elements our tuple is going to have (ex conn2)

  val conn = (80, "www", "google.com", true)
  val conn2 = Tuple4(80, "www", "google.com", true)

We can specify what data types we would like to have

	val conn = Tupple[Int | String](80, "www", "google.com", true)

Retrieve elements ( 2 ways)

1. conn(1) >> by index
2. conn._1 >> by position


Functions

conn.toString() >> will concatenate the elements into a string separated by comma
conn.productArity >> returns the size of the tuple
conn.copy(_2 = "ftp") >> returns a new copy of the original tuple "conn" with the position 2 updated to ftp
conn.swap >> returns a new tuple but with the values swapped (works only for tuple2)
conn ++ conn2 >> returns a new tuple concatenated from the 2 tuples given
