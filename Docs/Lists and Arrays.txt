List - Immutable, ordered collection that can contain duplicate elements

Data type which returns an empty list called Nil

We can limit the data type by providing a type in square brackets ex:
val m = List[Int](1, 2, 3, true) // error


We can have multidimensional lists

val matrix = 
 List(
	List(1, 0, 1),
	List(0, 1, 0),
	List(0, 0, 1)
)

Lists have head and tails

the head will be the first element of the list
the tail of the list is everything else except the first element


Array - Same as list but mutable, ordered collection

val t = Array(1,2,3,4)

We can limit the data type by providing a type in square brackets

val b = Array[String]("a", "b", test) // error

If we want to print an array we need can by running the following lines
a.foreach(println) << Iterates through each value and prints it
println(a.mkString) << It will concat all the values in a string
println(a.toList) << Transforms the array into a list and prints it

The size of the array cannot be changed

b = 0 +: a :+ 4
To add to the beginning of the array we specify the value followed by +:
To add after the elements of a we use :+ and the value

We can concatinate 2 arrays buy using ++ >>> c = a ++ b


ArrayBuffer - an array whose size can be changed

We can add or remove elements
We can also print the arraybuffer directly as it has a nicer format

To remove all elements of a collection we can use
a --= List(4,7,8)


Memory efficiency

Lists  > Array > ArrayBuffer
